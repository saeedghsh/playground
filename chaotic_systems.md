* [x] gererate chaotic processes via logistic maps

    + [ ] "lyapunov exponent" v.s. `r`: In mathematics the Lyapunov
      exponent or Lyapunov characteristic exponent of a dynamical
      system is a quantity that characterizes the rate of separation
      of infinitesimally close trajectories.

    + [ ] Two- and three-dimensional [Poincar√© plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_plot)
  - [ ] use [Tent map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_map) instead of "Logistic map"
  - [ ] use the "[hyperbolic tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions) map" instead of "Logistic map".
