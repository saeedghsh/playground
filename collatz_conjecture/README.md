# Collatz conjecture

The conjecture posits that no matter which positive integer is chosen initially, the sequence will always eventually reach the number 1. Despite its simplicity, the Collatz conjecture remains unproven and is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics.

It is also referred to as:
* $3n + 1$ problem
* Ulam conjecture
* Kakutani's problem
* Thwaites conjecture
* Hasse's algorithm
