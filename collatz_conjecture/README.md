# Collatz conjecture

The conjecture posits that no matter which positive integer is chosen initially, the sequence will always eventually reach the number 1. Despite its simplicity, the Collatz conjecture remains unproven and is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics.

It is also referred to as:
* $3n + 1$ problem
* Ulam conjecture
* Kakutani's problem
* Thwaites conjecture
* Hasse's algorithm

The sequence generated as follow:
1. select a positive integer number
2. next number := multiply by 3 and add 1 if it's odd, divide by two if it's even
3. keep applying the step 2 until "next number" is 1.
