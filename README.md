# Chaotic Systems

Python implementation and exprementation with few simplistic chaotic systems.
<!-- Also intended as an scaffold for starting python projects. -->

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py logisticmap --length 100 --count 500
```
for help:
```bash
python main.py -h
python main.py logisticmap -h
```

$ pip install pylint # pyreverse is now part of pylint
$ cd ~/code/ChaoticSystems
$ pyreverse -o svg -p chaos chaos/*.py
$ pyreverse -o svg -p chaoticSystems main.py
$ pyreverse -o svg -p testt ests/*.py
# -a N, -A    depth of research for ancestors
# -s N, -S    depth of research for associated classes
# -A, -S      all ancestors, resp. all associated
# -m[yn]      add or remove the module name
# -f MOD      filter the attributes : PUB_ONLY/SPECIAL/OTHER/ALL
# -k          show only the classes (no attributes and methods)
# -b          show 'builtin' objects
```

      exponent or Lyapunov characteristic exponent of a dynamical
      system is a quantity that characterizes the rate of separation
      of infinitesimally close trajectories.
